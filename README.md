# Auto dealership App
This is a toy project on course Data Base, aiming to learning-by-example and learning-by-doing for database concepts, techniques, and tools that are needed to develop a database application from scratch.
We build an toy website for the auto dealership owner, Jaunty Jalopies, to run his bussiness by:
1. update inventory
2. track sales
3. maintain repair history
4. search function for customers, managers and owner with different previleges.
